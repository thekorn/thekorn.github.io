## Challenge 2: Cross

Another day, it's freezing outside. A good opportunity to do some more tailwind. This time I got the inspiration directly from today's challenge at [CSSBattle.dev](https://cssbattle.dev)

## Result

<iframe
  src="/challenges/cross"
  height="400"
  width="100%"
  style="border:0;"
  allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"
  loading="lazy"
  title="Cross Challenge"
></iframe>

Easy!

## Learnings

- Tailwind won't ever wind you the 'fewest amount of CSS' award - but that's not the point. I am still positive that readability and accessibility for non-css-gods is more important. You want to center your content? - create a div spanning the full size of the parent via `inset-0{:html}`, use `flex{:html}`, `items-center{:html}` - cannot get simpler than that!
- Gradients with sharp color switches is a great way to color you shapes with different colors - no need to stack containers with relative positions and different respective colors.
