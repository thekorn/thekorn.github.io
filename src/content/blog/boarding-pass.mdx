## Challenge 3: Boarding Pass

After some very basic CSS implementations, I wanted to look into more complex designs. I found the figma community as a good starting point - and I took a boarding pass design as my first challange.

## Figma Designs

Used this community design by [Raveen Panditha](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1107654148967082978) as starting point.

  width="800"
  height="450"
  src="https://embed.figma.com/design/mBBYUAiYvkGKL6UrUN051Y/Boarding-Pass--Community-?node-id=0-1&embed-host=share"
  allowfullscreen
></iframe>

## Result

The complex part of the design implementation are the curved shapes. I decided to do two implementations - one using <Code code={`clip-path: path(...)`} lang="css" inline /> and one using svg image masks.

### Front

<div class="not-prose flex flex-col gap-4 md:w-[840px] md:flex-row">
  <div class="flex w-full flex-col">
    <h4>svg mask</h4>
    <iframe
      src="/challenges/boardingPass"
      height="844"
      width="100%"
      style="border:0;"
      allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"
      loading="lazy"
      title="Boarding Pass Challenge"
    ></iframe>
  </div>
  <div class="flex w-full flex-col">
    <h4>clip-path</h4>
    <iframe
      src="/challenges/boardingPass-v2"
      height="844"
      width="100%"
      style="border:0;"
      allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"
      loading="lazy"
      title="Boarding Pass Challenge"
    ></iframe>
  </div>
</div>
### Back

TBD ;)

## Learnings

- [affinity studio](https://www.affinity.studio) is an amazing free design tool.
- proper shadow on masked divs is a pain - no idea how to do it properly yet.
- whereas when using <Code code={`clip-path: path(...)`} lang="css" inline /> a shadow must be applied to the parent.
