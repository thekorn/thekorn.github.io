## Challenge 3: Boarding Pass

After some very basic CSS implementations, I wanted to look into more complex designs. I found the figma community as a good starting point - and I took a boarding pass design as my first challange.

## Figma Designs

Used this community design by [Raveen Panditha](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1107654148967082978) as starting point.

  allowfullscreen
></iframe>

## Result

### Front

<iframe
  src="/challenges/boardingPass"
  height="844"
  width="100%"
  style="border:0;"
  allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"
  loading="lazy"
  title="Boarding Pass Challenge"
></iframe>

### Back

TBD ;)

## Learnings

- [affinity studio](https://www.affinity.studio) is an amazing free design tool.
- proper shadow on masked divs is a pain - no idea how to do it properly yet.
